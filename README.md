# Executive Summary

Here, we present insights into the existing collaboration dynamics of state universities and colleges (SUC) in the Philippines. Ultimately, the objective is to
contribute to optimizing the R&D productivity of SUCs, a critical component in the generation of new knowledge, fostering innovation, and the long-term economic development of a developing country. 

In our approach, we identified three progressive profile sets of SUC co-authorship networks that can be useful in crafting strategies to further collaborations. To wit, networks in Profile 1 were found to be highly disconnected with no prominent components; instead, they consist of dyads, small star-like networks (ego), and small isolated cliques. We also differentiated between co-authorship networks comparable to small-world networks (Profile 2) and Profile 3, which implicates the emergence of large components from the eventual linkage of smaller components found in both Profile 1 and 2. From here, university-level policies are suggested to improve or develop research collaboration systems. 

We also performed exploratory network analysis to identify critical entities in the networks, exploring various centrality measures focused on insights-extraction. As part of the descriptive analysis, we also extracted network communities that may be significant in helping funding agencies identify relevant R&D programs for various SUCs.

A projected inter-university author network was also formed using topics as connections. We extracted notable authors and identified communities that can serve as working groups for identified topics.
